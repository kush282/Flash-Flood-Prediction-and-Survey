# Flash-Flood-Prediction-and-Survey
Overview

This project involves a comprehensive survey of flash floods, spanning from 1990 to 2023. The primary objective is to analyze geological and meteorological data to predict precipitation levels and classify rainfall periods to identify high-risk flash flood occurrences.
Dataset

    Timeframe: 1990â€“2023
    Features: 63 geological and environmental factors related to flash floods.

Methodology

    Data Analysis:
        Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and relationships.
        Computed the correlation matrix to identify significant relationships between features and precipitation levels.

    Model Development:
        Developed multiple regression-based models to predict precipitation using the dataset.
        Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.

    Hybrid Model Creation:
        Selected the two best-performing regression models.
        Combined the models in varying proportions to develop a hybrid model optimized for the highest accuracy.

    Rainfall Classification:
        Classified rainfall data cumulatively to identify risky periods prone to flash floods.
        Used statistical and machine learning techniques to group rainfall levels and assign risk labels.

Key Features of the Study

    Geological Insights: Leveraged 63 features to understand the relationship between geological factors and precipitation.
    Hybrid Model: An innovative approach combining two models for enhanced predictive accuracy.
    Risk Analysis: Identified high-risk periods for flash floods, enabling better preparedness and disaster management.

Results

    Prediction Accuracy: The hybrid model showed a significant improvement over individual models.
    Risk Identification: Successfully classified rainfall data into cumulative risk categories.
